# Web App Screenshots

## How to Generate Screenshots

Since this was developed in a CLI environment, actual screenshots need to be generated by opening the web app in a browser.

### Steps to Create Screenshots:

1. **Open the Web App:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/todo-app-demo
   open public/index.html
   ```

2. **Add Sample Tasks:**
   - Add a high-priority work task: "Complete project report"
   - Add a medium-priority study task: "Learn JavaScript"
   - Add a low-priority shopping task: "Buy groceries"
   - Mark one task as completed

3. **Screenshot Light Mode:**
   - Ensure light mode is active
   - Take a full-page screenshot
   - Save as `screenshots/web-light-mode.png`

4. **Screenshot Dark Mode:**
   - Click the theme toggle button (🌙/☀️)
   - Take a full-page screenshot
   - Save as `screenshots/web-dark-mode.png`

## What the App Looks Like

### Light Mode Features:
- Clean white background (#f5f7fa)
